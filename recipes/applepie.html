    <h4>This easy apple pie recipe belongs to my mother. 
        I make it all the time when I want a simple homemade pie. I love it! 
        I often add a dash of nutmeg to the apple filling.</h4>
        <p>
            An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling is apples. 
            Apple pie is often served with whipped cream, ice cream ("apple pie à la mode"), custard or cheddar cheese.
            It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed
             (woven of crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately ("blind") to prevent it from getting soggy. 
             Deep-dish apple pie often has a top crust only. Tarte Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on the 
             bottom.

        <h4>Ingredients List</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>6 cups thinly sliced apples</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cooking Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Line a 9-inch pie dish with one pastry crust; set second one aside.</li>
            <li>Combine 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add more sugar if your apples are tart.</li>
            <li>Layer apple slices in the prepared pie dish, sprinkling each layer with cinnamon-sugar mixture.</li>
            <li>Dot top layer with small pieces of butter. Cover with top crust.</li>
            <li>Bake pie on the lowest rack of the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until golden brown and filling bubbles, 30 to 35 minutes more.</li>
